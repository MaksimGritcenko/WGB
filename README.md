## Setup on existing Magento

Already have an existing Magento installation? ScandiPWA is a regular Magento theme. We can install it on existing Magento instance using composer.

### Ready to try?

## Setup with remote server

If you are planning to developer a back-end functionality, but to modify the front-end only, can can try setting up the theme with remote Magento 2 server.

> **NOTE!** it is impossible to test the website in production mode (of the webpack build). This is the main downside of this approach.
